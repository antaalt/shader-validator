If your issue is related to the features of the extension (goto, diagnostics, enhancement), please post your issue to the [language server repository](https://github.com/antaalt/shader-sense/issues) instead. 

This repository is for the extension only and all its mostly UI related issues.

If you are not sure, feel free to post here, issue might be transfered.
