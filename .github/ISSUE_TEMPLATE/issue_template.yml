        If your issue is related to the features of the extension (goto, diagnostics, enhancement), please post your issue to the [shader-sense language server repository](https://github.com/antaalt/shader-sense/issues) instead. This repository is for the extension only and is mostly UI related issues. If you are not sure, feel free to post here, issue might be transfered.

        Do not hesitate to check the logs of the extension first. You can do so by setting `shader-validator.trace.server` to messages or verbose and check the extension log (accessible via status bar).
