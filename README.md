# hlsl README

This is the README for your extension "hlsl". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Why
Not much efficient & light HLSL linter / highlighter easy to maintain & up to date. Most of them are abandonned.  
- (Shader languages support for VS Code)[https://github.com/stef-levesque/vscode-shader] does not offer shader linting but still cool providing features that works well. 
- (HLSL Tools)[https://github.com/tgjones/HlslTools] it offer linting by rewriting a complete pseudo HLSL compiler for HLSL which make it really tedious to maintain & update with newer HLSL version.
- (HLSL linter)[https://github.com/A2K/vscode-hlsl-linter] really basic linting but works with DXC which make it easy to update.
- (vscode-wgsl)[https://github.com/PolyMeilex/vscode-wgsl] a nice API with a rust backend server to lint & provide functionnalities for wgsl only using Naga.


## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:
